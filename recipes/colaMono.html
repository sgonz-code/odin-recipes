    <h1>Cola de Mono</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a traditional Chilean Christmastime drink of milk flavored with coffee and spices, passed down to me by our Chilean nanny Isa. It is delicious, and a must-try if you don't care for egg-nog. The recipe can be varied to suit your tastes - be creative with the proportions of coffee, cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla, as well as with your choice of liqueurs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>20 whole cloves</li>
        <li>5 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 gallon cold milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup instant coffee granules</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup pisco, white rum, brandy, or other lightly-flavored liquor</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently simmer the cloves and cinnamon sticks in water until reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Add 1 cup of milk, and heat to a simmer, then stir in and dissolve the coffee and sugar.</li>
        <li>Strain the coffee mixture into the remaining cold milk, and discard the cloves and cinnamon sticks. Stir in the vanilla extract and pisco. Store in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
